# [Throwing Knives]
## About
With this plugin installed on your server, players will be able to access throwing knives.
In order for the player to throw a knife, they must have their knife equipped and use their left mouse button (default key). By doing so a knife is thrown in the direction the player is looking towards, and any enemy hit by the thrown knife will take damage.


## Additional Information
This plugin was originally made by meng, then Bacardi picked up the project and rewrote i. Unfortunately Bacardi's version appeared to be causing server crashes on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive game servers running on the Linux operating system. This version is made specifically for CS:GO, it should however support both Linux and Windows, and as far as we've been able to test for ourselves, this version appears to be stable.
